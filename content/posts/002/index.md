### An Example Calculation:

Let's walk through an example calculation using the date 11/28/1990:

#### 1.  Fill the Day, Month and Year of Birth:
    -   First Number: Take the day of birth, which is 28. Since it's greater than 22, add up the digits: 28 = 2 + 8 = 10.
    -   Second Number: Consider the month of birth, which is 11.
    -   Third Number: Add all the digits of the year of birth: 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 19.
#### 2.  Calculate the Karmic Number:
    -   Add the known numbers from the corners: 10 + 11 + 19 = 40. Simplify it further: 4 + 0 = 4. This karmic number signifies the primary task of your soul for this incarnation.
#### 3.  Calculate the Center of the Matrix:
    -   Add all the known numbers, including the karmic number: 10 + 11 + 19 + 4 = 44. Simplify it to 8. Write the number 8 in the center of your Destiny Matrix, representing the point of spiritual comfort.
#### 4.  Calculate the numbers in-between:
    -   Add the numbers from the corners. Simplify it and write it down.
